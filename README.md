# CTOS Boot screen S10
While trying out several Watchdogs bootanimations, I realised that no matter what I did, I'm still gonna get Samsung's same old "Powered by Android :droid:" footer anyways. So while experimenting, I was successfully able to hide it with a nicer looking "Powered by CTOS :ctoslogo:" footer. Not sure if this would work on other S10x devices, only tried on my personal S10+ beyond2lte, rooted and running Bananadroid, but should work on AOSP roms, non rooted.

## To install
Just boot into download mode, and flash the tar file in AP slot of odin. Tar file also hides the "unlocked bootloader" message.
